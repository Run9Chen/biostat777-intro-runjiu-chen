Hello! I'm **Runjiu Chen**, currently pursuing my **ScM in Genetic Epidemiology** at the **Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health**. My academic journey began at **Hunan University**, where I majored in **Statistics** and developed a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, data analysis, and computational methods. I also spent a semester at **UC Berkeley**, studying advanced statistics and data science.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **statistical genetics**, **computational biology**, and **machine learning**. I am passionate about developing and applying quantitative methods to understand the complex biological mechanisms underlying human diseases---particularly through **spatiotemporal modeling**, **gene expression analysis**, and **multi-omics data integration**.

STW-MD: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Weighting and Multi-Step Decision Tree Method for Considering Spatial Heterogeneity in Brain Gene Expression Data

Briefings In Bioinformatics

In this work, I developed a two-step machine learning framework to analyze gene expression during brain development and Alzheimer's disease (AD). My contributions focused on coding and model enhancement, including the implementation of spatial-temporal information weighting to capture dependencies across stages and brain regions. I also improved the model by integrating multi-step decision trees, boosting its ability to identify gene classes and their impact on brain development and AD progression. These machine learning techniques significantly improved the analysis of gene expression in heterogeneous brain regions.

Cell Lineage Tracing: methods, applications, and challenges

Quantitative Biology

I primarily contributed to the computational analysis section, specifically focusing on the application of RNA velocity methods. My work involved implementing the RNA velocity approach to infer the directional dynamics of single-cell transcriptomes, enabling the reconstruction of cellular lineage trajectories and fate decisions. This included data preprocessing, model selection, parameter tuning, and the interpretation of resulting velocity vectors to reveal the temporal progression of cellular states. Additionally, I contributed to the integration of multi-omics data to enhance the resolution and biological relevance of the lineage inference, ensuring that the computational framework accurately captured the underlying biological processes.
