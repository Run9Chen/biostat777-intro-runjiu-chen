    "text": "Hello! I’m Runjiu Chen, currently pursuing my ScM in Genetic Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My academic journey began at Hunan University, where I majored in Statistics and developed a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, data analysis, and computational methods. I also spent a semester at UC Berkeley, studying advanced statistics and data science.\nMy research interests lie at the intersection of statistical genetics, computational biology, and machine learning. I am passionate about developing and applying quantitative methods to understand the complex biological mechanisms underlying human diseases—particularly through spatiotemporal modeling, gene expression analysis, and multi-omics data integration.\n\nPublication\nSTW-MD: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Weighting and Multi-Step Decision Tree Method for Considering Spatial Heterogeneity in Brain Gene Expression Data\nBriefings In Bioinformatics\nIn this work, I developed a two-step machine learning framework to analyze gene expression during brain development and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). My contributions focused on coding and model enhancement, including the implementation of spatial-temporal information weighting to capture dependencies across stages and brain regions. I also improved the model by integrating multi-step decision trees, boosting its ability to identify gene classes and their impact on brain development and AD progression. These machine learning techniques significantly improved the analysis of gene expression in heterogeneous brain regions.\nCell Lineage Tracing: methods, applications, and challenges\nQuantitative Biology\nI primarily contributed to the computational analysis section, specifically focusing on the application of RNA velocity methods. My work involved implementing the RNA velocity approach to infer the directional dynamics of single-cell transcriptomes, enabling the reconstruction of cellular lineage trajectories and fate decisions. This included data preprocessing, model selection, parameter tuning, and the interpretation of resulting velocity vectors to reveal the temporal progression of cellular states. Additionally, I contributed to the integration of multi-omics data to enhance the resolution and biological relevance of the lineage inference, ensuring that the computational framework accurately captured the underlying biological processes."

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nIn this hospital sample of adults with T2DM, probable depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) was common and varied by sex and age. Higher depressive symptom burden showed a modest positive association with HbA1c, and a clear negative association with the dataset’s “Total Score”, which likely captures better self-management or health status. A simple logistic regression using HbA1c, age, sex, and Total Score provided interpretable odds ratios with sensible directions of effect. While results are cross-sectional and rely on screening (not diagnosis), they demonstrate how routinely collected variables can prioritize patients for further mental-health assessment. Future work could validate the model prospectively and incorporate more granular self-management behaviors."
