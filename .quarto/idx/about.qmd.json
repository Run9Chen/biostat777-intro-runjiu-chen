My contributions focused on coding and model enhancement, including the implementation of spatial-temporal information weighting to capture dependencies across stages and brain regions. I also improved the model by integrating multi-step decision trees, boosting its ability to identify gene classes and their impact on brain development and AD progression.

My work involved implementing the RNA velocity approach to infer the directional dynamics of single-cell transcriptomes, enabling the reconstruction of cellular lineage trajectories and fate decisions. This included data preprocessing, model selection, parameter tuning, and the interpretation of resulting velocity vectors to reveal the temporal progression of cellular states. Additionally, I contributed to the integration of multi-omics data to enhance the resolution and biological relevance of the lineage inference, ensuring that the computational framework accurately captured the underlying biological processes.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nHello!
